Another thought on improvement would be to use a different form of hyper-
parameter tuning. GridSearchCV is exhaustive, but RandomSearchCV should
sample fewer data points and, therefore, be quicker.

I looked up the wiki page for the mnist dataset and it shows a table of the
best error scores by classifier, distortion, and preprocessing. The two
best classifiers are Convolutional neural networks and Support-Vector
Machines.

Want to test an SVM to see how it's performance goes. Then I want to try
to see if I can use any data augmentation.
