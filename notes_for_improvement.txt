Another thought on improvement would be to use a different form of hyper-
parameter tuning. GridSearchCV is exhaustive, but RandomSearchCV should
sample fewer data points and, therefore, be quicker.

Next steps is to try other forms of classifiers. I want to try some neural
network for this project. MLPClassifier will probably be the next option.
