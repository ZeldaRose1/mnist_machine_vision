The next steps on this are to implement some form of dimensionality reduction.
We could try to select only the most influential columns, or we could try to
combine columns through something like PCA.

Either way would allow us to be more precise by increasing the speed of model
training. As it stands now there is too much data for my pc to run hyper-
parameter tuning. If we had fewer dimensions, we could probably tune more
easily.

Another thought on improvement would be to use a different form of hyper-
parameter tuning. GridSearchCV is exhaustive, but RandomSearchCV should
sample fewer data points and, therefore, be quicker.
